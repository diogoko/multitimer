multitimer
==========

multitimer is a simple countdown timer that allows entering multiple countdowns. It was created when I couldn't find an online timer for using with some workouts from [neilarey.com](http://neilarey.com/).

Besides showing the overall progress this app plays sounds whenever an intermediate countdown ends (and a different sound when the whole timer finishes).

Try the [DEMO](http://multitimer.herokuapp.com/).
